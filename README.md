# mobile movie app

I develop this app when I take mobile programming class as a semester project. I used Movie API to bring movie ranking and movie information. When the user clicks a search button, it can list up the top 10 box office ranking of the current date. It includes rank, movie name, release date, total revenue, number of audience and screens.

## About this app

* I used Trivia API which provides free JSON API. I used question, correct answer, incorrect answer to develop a simple quiz app related to computers. While a user solves the quiz, they can get a feedback from the answer.
